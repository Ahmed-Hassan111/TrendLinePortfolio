        Delicious Bites was founded in 2010 with a simple mission: to create
        exceptional food and beverage products using high-quality ingredients
        and traditional techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        What began as a small operation in a home kitchen has grown into a
        beloved brand known for its commitment to quality, sustainability, and
        incredible flavors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we continue to handcraft our products in small batches, ensuring
        that each item meets our exacting standards before it reaches your
        table.
